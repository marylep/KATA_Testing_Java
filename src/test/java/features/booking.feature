#  There seems to be a bug with the check out date and on the confirmation pop up the check out date in one date after the one selected.
#  In order for the tests to pass on step in line 20 we provide the wrong date as an input.
#  Also for the purposes of these tests the booking is done considering all days between check in and check out are on the same month.
